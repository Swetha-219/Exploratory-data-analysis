data analysis on movie data set
The data set I chose is Movie dataset

Here are some notes and comments about this datasets : This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.

There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.

The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

The questions about this dataset:
Does higher budget mean higher popularity ? Is there a coefficent relationship ?

Will the runtime affect the vote count and popularity?

Higher popularity means higher profits ?

What Features are Associate with Top 10 Revenue Movies ?

Which genres are most popular from year to year?


Conclusion:
Based on the analysis I did above, we can make the following summarizations:

The quantity and range of movie gets larger.We have more choices to choose from as an audience.
We can not say high budget guarantees high popularity. But for movies with higher budgets do produce higher average popularity.
To produce a more popular movie, the runtime should be best around 150 mins; Drama, Comedy, Action, these genres would be preferable.
